# My AI-Enhanced Development Workflow

This section details my complete development workflow combining multiple AI tools for maximum productivity.

## Think-Then-Code: My Core Philosophy

I've discovered that the most effective approach to AI-assisted development follows a simple pattern: use thinking models for the hard stuff, then switch to fast models for implementation. It's like having two different team members - one who's brilliant at architecture and planning (but takes their time), and another who's incredibly fast at coding once they know what to build.

### Thinking Models

When I need to solve complex problems or design systems, I turn to what I call "thinking models":

Examples include **Claude Opus 4**, **GPT-4 o1**, and **Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Think**. These models can take 30 seconds to several minutes to respond, but the depth of analysis is worth it. They excel at:
- Architectural decisions and system design
- Complex problem-solving and edge case analysis
- Mathematical problems and algorithm optimization
- Analyzing large codebases and understanding existing systems

### Fast Implementation Models

Once I have a clear plan, I switch to faster models for the actual coding:

Examples include **Claude Sonnet 4**, **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, and **GPT-4 Turbo**. These are lightning fast and perfect for:
- Code generation and implementation
- Simple transformations and boilerplate code
- Quick iterations without waiting
- Refactoring and code cleanup

## My SDLC Workflow with AI

### Phase 1: Planning and Defining

During the planning phase, I collaborate with thinking models as co-architects. Here's my typical process:

1. **Initial brainstorming** - I describe the problem in natural language, asking for multiple architectural approaches
2. **Requirements analysis** - I paste in user stories, emails, or meeting notes and ask the AI to help structure them into clear requirements
3. **Technology selection** - I discuss trade-offs between different tech stacks, getting pros and cons for each option
4. **Risk assessment** - I ask the AI to play devil's advocate and identify potential issues I might have missed

The key is treating the AI as a knowledgeable colleague who can offer perspectives I might not have considered.

### Phase 2: Designing

This is where thinking models really shine. I use them to:

- Create system architecture diagrams (using Mermaid or PlantUML syntax)
- Design database schemas with proper relationships
- Plan API contracts and service boundaries
- Identify design patterns that fit the problem

I always create a comprehensive design document that includes:
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Component responsibilities
- Data flow diagrams
- Integration points

This document becomes crucial context for the implementation phase.

### Phase 3: Building

Here's where I make the switch from thinking models to fast models. The thorough planning and documentation from earlier phases means I can give clear, specific instructions to faster models without sacrificing quality.

My implementation workflow:

1. **Set up context** - I provide the fast model with:
   - The relevant parts of my design document
   - Existing code structure
   - Coding standards and patterns we're following
   - Any specific libraries or frameworks we're using

2. **Incremental development** - I break features into small, manageable chunks:
   - Each chunk should be completable in one session
   - Clear acceptance criteria for each piece
   - Regular commits to preserve working states

3. **Use MCP for live data** - Instead of copying and pasting, I let the AI access:
   - Current codebase through filesystem MCP
   - Azure DevOps for work items and pull requests
   - Documentation repositories
   - Test results and build logs

## Managing Context Effectively

One of the biggest lessons I've learned is that context management makes or breaks AI effectiveness. Here's how I handle it:

### Project Configuration Files

I maintain several configuration files that guide AI behavior:

**.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Contains our team's coding standards, naming conventions, and architectural patterns

**CLAUDE.md** - Project-specific context including:
- Common commands and workflows
- Project structure explanation
- Recent architectural decisions
- Known issues and their solutions

**.cursorrules** (if using Cursor) - IDE-specific rules for code generation

### Dynamic Context Loading

Rather than dumping everything into the AI's context, I'm selective:
- Start with minimal context
- Add specific files as needed using @ references
- Remove irrelevant context to maintain focus
- Use file summaries instead of full files when possible

## Handling AI Loops and Stuck States

AI assistants can get stuck, especially when debugging. Here's my recovery process:

### Recognizing the Signs

- The AI keeps suggesting the same fix repeatedly
- Error messages don't change despite "fixes"
- The suggestions become increasingly generic
- The AI starts contradicting its earlier advice

### My Recovery Strategy

1. **Stop immediately** - Don't keep pushing the same approach
2. **Stash your changes** - Use `git stash` to save current work
3. **Revert to last working commit** - Get back to a known good state
4. **Reset the context** - Start a fresh conversation
5. **Try a different angle**:
   - Switch to a different model
   - Rephrase the problem
   - Provide a minimal reproduction case
   - Ask for multiple alternative approaches

### Preventing Loops

I've found these techniques help prevent getting stuck:
- Be specific about what's not working
- Provide exact error messages
- Share what you've already tried
- Ask for reasoning before solutions
- Request multiple approaches upfront

## Documentation with Thinking Models

For documentation, I always use thinking models because they:
- Understand the broader context better
- Write more coherent explanations
- Can analyze code and explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Generate better examples and use cases

My documentation workflow:
1. Feed the thinking model the code and any existing docs
2. Ask for specific documentation types (API docs, tutorials, architecture guides)
3. Review and refine with follow-up questions
4. Let the AI help identify what documentation is missing

## Version Control in the AI Era

Working with AI-generated code requires some adjustments to version control practices:

### Commit Strategy

- **Frequent, small commits** - Makes it easier to revert if the AI leads you astray
- **Clear commit messages** - I indicate when significant portions are AI-generated
- **Branch protection** - Never commit directly to main; always use pull requests
- **Human review required** - AI-generated code always gets human eyes before merging

### When Things Go Wrong

Sometimes AI sends you down the wrong path. That's why I:
- Keep commits small and atomic
- Don't hesitate to `git reset --hard` to last known good state
- Use `git stash` liberally when experimenting
- Maintain a "lessons learned" log for failed approaches

## Real-World Example: My Typical Day

Here's how this all comes together in practice:

**Morning: Planning Session**
- Review today's tasks in Azure DevOps
- Use a thinking model to analyze the most complex task
- Create a rough implementation plan

**Mid-Morning: Implementation**
- Switch to a fast model
- Implement features incrementally
- Commit working code frequently

**Afternoon: Review and Refine**
- Use thinking models to review the morning's work
- Generate tests and documentation
- Polish and optimize

**End of Day: Documentation**
- Update CLAUDE.md with new learnings
- Document any new patterns discovered
- Prepare context for tomorrow

## Key Takeaways

The most important lessons I've learned:

1. **Match the model to the task** - Thinking models for hard problems, fast models for implementation
2. **Context is everything** - Well-organized context files and selective loading make AI much more effective
3. **Incremental progress** - Small, focused sessions are better than marathon coding
4. **Embrace the reset** - Don't fight with a stuck AI; start fresh
5. **Document constantly** - Your future self (and the AI) will thank you

This workflow has transformed how I develop software. It's not about replacing my skillsâ€”it's about amplifying them. The AI handles the tedious parts while I focus on the creative and strategic decisions that only a human can make.
